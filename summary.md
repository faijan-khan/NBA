| `OpenCV (cv2)`         | Extract frames from video                                      |
| `PaddleOCR`            | Optical character recognition on frames                        |
| `pandas`               | Tabular data manipulation & CSV creation                       |
| `matplotlib + seaborn` | Create line plots, heatmaps, bar charts for brand visibility   |

### ⚙️ Pipeline Steps (Defined in `pipeline.py`)

1. **Download YouTube Video**
2. **Extract Frames (1 FPS)**
3. **Run OCR using PaddleOCR**
4. **Count Brand Mentions (exact or fuzzy)**
5. **Create Visuals (stacked plots, line charts, heatmaps)**
6. **Generate Professional PDF Report**
7. **Email Report to User**

---

### 📨 Emailing Results

* Configured with Gmail SMTP
* Uses `smtplib` + `email.message.EmailMessage`
* Email credentials stored in `.env` file
* Sends the final PDF report as an attachment

---

## 🖥️ **Frontend: Vanilla HTML + CSS + JavaScript**

### 📁 Folder Structure (Simplified)

```
/frontend
├── index.html         # Main page
├── style.css          # Styling
└── script.js          # JS for form handling and interaction
```

### 🧩 Functionality

* User inputs:

  * ✅ YouTube URL
  * ✅ Brand selections (checkboxes)
  * ✅ Model type (radio buttons)
  * ✅ Email address
* UI auto-loads embedded YouTube video preview
* Submits data using `fetch()` POST to FastAPI
* Shows visual feedback (spinners, buttons, progress messages)

## 🔄 **Async Architecture**

| Layer       | Technology     | Role                                    |
| ----------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Frontend    | HTML/CSS/JS    | UI for input and response display       |
| Backend API | FastAPI        | Receives form data, starts async job    |
| Worker      | Celery + Redis | Runs long processing jobs independently |
| Storage     | Local FS       | Stores intermediate files + PDF         |
| Output      | Email          | Sends result back to the user           |

---

## 📈 Output Artifacts

* `brand_analysis.csv`: Visibility scores per frame
